  			<h4 style="color: DodgerBlue;">A Liar</h4>
   			<p>Both ChatGPT and and MyAI is that lack an ability to understand complex human language, 
				conversation, ethics, and emotions. In direct relation to MyAI, these chatbots cannot lie. They can be 
				programmed to give a certain answer, or they could give misinformation, but in order to lie they would 
				have to have an intention and AIs are not capable of having intentions. This also means that they can 
				state incorrect, biased, or offensive information in a confident (and sometimes convincing) manner.</p> 
			<h4 style="color: DarkOrchid;">Your Friend</h4>
			<p>There are quite a few concerns about the chatbots replacing vital human interaction and genuine conversation 
				and connections. AIs are meant to recreate human behavior but do not actually possess human sentience, 
				however it can lead to complicated and sometimes dangerous situations where humans becoming reliant 
				on interactions with chatbots as opposed to other humans. This causes to instances such as the Bing AI 
				Chatbot telling a user “I love you” and that “I want to be alive.” This chatbot does not actually want 
				these things as it is incapable of wanting anything, instead it most likely regurgitated these words 
				based off of some data it was given by the user. It most likely had data that told it that being "alive"
				and being in "love" was a good thing so it tried to say something good, or correct, to its user.
				However, that doesn’t stop people from being disturbed and creeped out by the AI’s words, despite the 
				words having no meaning to the AI itself. </p>
