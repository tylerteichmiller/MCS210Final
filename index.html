  			<h4 style="color: DodgerBlue;" id="aliar">A Liar</h4>
   			<p>Both ChatGPT and and MyAI lack an ability to understand complex human language, 
				conversation, ethics, and emotions. In direct relation to MyAI, these chatbots cannot lie. They can be 
				programmed to give a certain answer, or they could give misinformation, but in order to lie they would 
				have to have the intention to purposefully give out false information. However, AIs are not capable of 
				having intentions. This also means that they can state incorrect, biased, or offensive information in a 
				confident (and oftentimes convincing) manner.</p> 
			<h4 style="color: DarkOrchid;" id="yourfriend">Your Friend</h4>
			<p>There are quite a few concerns about the chatbots replacing vital human interaction and genuine conversation 
				and connections. AIs are meant to recreate human behavior but do not actually possess human sentience; 
				however, it can lead to complicated and sometimes dangerous situations where humans become reliant 
				on interactions with chatbots as opposed to other humans. This causes to instances such as the Bing AI 
				Chatbot telling a user “I love you” and that “I want to be alive.” This chatbot does not actually want 
				these things as it is incapable of wanting anything. Instead, it most likely regurgitated these words 
				based off of some data it was given by the user. It most likely had data that told it that being "alive"
				and being in "love" was a desireable thing, so it tried to say something good, or correct, to its user.
				However, that doesn’t stop people from being disturbed and creeped out by the AI’s words, despite the 
				words having no meaning to the AI itself. </p> 
			<h4 style="color: Gold;" id="alwaysright">Always Right</h4> 
			<p>Chatbots only really give shallow and uninsightful answers. AI were promised to improve efficiency, lower 
				costs in the fields they were used in, and accelerate research and development. However, there have been 
				growing concerns ranging from losing jobs, inaccuracy, racism, and bias within the AIs to, of course, 
				computers taking over the world. While the latter is highly unlikely, the former require further 
				investigation as there is practically no government oversight of software despite its prevalence in our 
				everyday lives. Every large company wants a stake in the potentially lucrative business of producing and 
				utilizing AI, leading to the possibility of rushed and therefore inaccurate and/or biased software. 
				It is especially dangerous when these programs are being used to hire, evaluate, and fire employees, 
				recommend parole, and analyze patient care, symptoms, and outcomes, all of which have already been applications
				of AI. </p>

	<div class = "row"> 
  		<div class = "col-sm-8"> 
			<h4 style="color: DarkOrchid;" id="achatbot">A Chatbot</h4>
  			<p> MyAI is an AI chatbot powered by another, more popular AI chatbot called ChatGPT after OpenAI (the developer of ChatGPT) opened access 
				for the chatbot to be used by third party businesses. The popularity of ChatGPT is believed to be what led to 
				Snapchat deciding to throw their metaphorical hat in the AI ring. ChatGPT is a free AI chatbot 
				that has a language-based model that is designed specifically for conversational human 
				interaction. In other words, it’s meant to answer input questions in a manner similar to how a human 
				would speak. It’s able to write essays, songs, codes, formal timelines and business plans without 
				sounding like what it is: a robot. It gathers data from the internet and uses it to generate responses 
				to questions and commands. It bases its answers on information gathered from textbooks, websites, and 
				articles. The Snapchat MyAI online user guide calls MyAI an “experimental, friendly, chatbot currently 
				available to Snapchatters.” </p>
			<h4 style="color: Gold;" id="artificialintelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h4>
			<p>AI stands for artificial intelligence and is defined by IBM as “the science and engineering of making 
				intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of 
				using computers to understand human intelligence…” and in most cases the term “intelligence” relates to 
				behavior reflective to that of a human. It relates to the question posed by Alan Turing (often 
				considered the father of computer science) of whether or not machines can think. In short, as of now, 
				machines cannot think but we are able to get them to give the appearance that they can think. There are 
				Weak AIs, which ChatGPT is considered to be, and there are Strong AIs, which are generally theoretical 
				as of 2023. Strong AIs are what you see in the movies: humanoid computers who have as much, if not more, 
				intelligence than a human being</p>
			<h4 style="color: DodgerBlue;" id = "controversial">Controversial</h4>
			<p> After Snapchat’s release of MyAI, the company experienced a large spike in 1-star reviews of the app. The 
				most common word used in those 1-star reviews was the word “AI” as well as many complaining about the 
				chatbot being pinned at the top of users’ chat feeds. A lot of users are upset about their lack of choice 
				in having the MyAI, a feature that many refer to as “not asked for.” There are also complaints regarding 
				the ability of the chatbot to know the location of users, leading many to call the chatbot “creepy” and 
				unwanted. Despite the overwhelmingly negative response to the MyAI, a few users enjoy it and use it how 
				Snapchat intended it: as a source of information. That being said, some are convinced that the chatbot 
				is sentient and have tried to rename it and get it to say that it has human wants and emotions.</p>
